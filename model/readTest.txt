description = in this experiment I try to assess some certain parameters relating...

m 	= 			10	!number of rows
n 	= 			10	!number of columns

!climate /landscape parameters:
np 	= 			100 		!number of particles of rain falling
roughness = 	0.1

nSteps 	= 		100 			!total number of "years"

!veg change variables
tPersist = 		200
sEmerge = 		120
isSEmerge = 	1			!flag denotes whether to use random collonisation pc or storage based sEmerge
vegmax = 		9			!maximum biomass
pc = 			-1			!prob of collonisation of bare soil


tSteps= 		200 		!number of iterations for evap calcs between veg change

pa = 			400 		!mean annual precip
ts =	 		1.287670000000000E-002  !duration raining !12.0/365.0 !duration in years of time raining

!infiltration kernel parameters:
K0 =  			0.3847440 	!in mm/hr 
Kmax = 			1.6155901 	!in mm/hr
kf = 			0.8 		!per meter : rate of decline in plant effect on infiltration
rf = 			5  			! meter: maximum length for plant effect on infiltration
dx = 			1			!spatial dimesions of lattice cells


Emax = 			876 		! 0.5 * (365.0* 24.0)  from mm/hr to mm/year

!evaporation kernel parameters
kc = 			0.8 		!per meter : rate of decline in plant water uptake with distance
rc = 			5 			!meter: maximum length for plant water uptake
gamma = 		0.5 		!relative reduction of soil evap under canopy
bav = 			0.1  		!scaling factor for Esb calc

!erosion 
kv = 0.1d0 !10.0
kb = 0.1d0
Dv = 0.1d0 !1.0
Db = 0.1d0 !m^2/kyr

topogRoute	= T !if true, then use topography to route flows
simErosion	= T !if true, then simulate erosion and update flow pathways
simEvap		= T !if true, then simulate evaporation
simVegEvolve	= T !if true, then simulate evolving vegetation
RandomInVeg	= T !if true, then allow vegetation to be randomly distributed initially, othewrwise set all veg to 0
