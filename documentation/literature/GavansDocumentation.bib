	Abstract = {Self--organised vegetation patterns arise in water limited systems as a result of the interac- tion of short range facilitation and long range competition. On smooth and gently sloped terrain banded vegetation patterns are known to spontaneously emerge as a result of these feedbacks. These ecohy- drological interactions can also impact erosion and thus alter the long term variation in surface water redistribution patterns via changes to the topography. We explore the effect of this additional process on the geomorphology and spatial organisation of vegetation. The model is shown capable of reproducing banded vegetation patterns on a smooth hillslope in the absence of erosion. With significant fluvial ero- sion vegetation bands degrade and instead form a complex network of patchy vegetation colonizing main drainage channels. These channels in turn dissect a lumpy microtopography associated with the patches, containing a characteristic mound scale. This type of landform contains features resembling some real patchy semiarid hills. Decreasing the extent to which plants can locally increase soil hydraulic conductiv- ity causes the resulting landform and vegetation pattern to be significantly different. Models investigating this co-evolution of form and function appear to offer new insights into the dynamics of water limited ecosystems.},

	Abstract = {A new algorithm is developed to extract flow paths from digital elevation data without planar dispersion on the basis of the concept of global search. Widely used nondispersive algorithms, such as deterministic eight-neighbor flow direction retrieval algorithms, suffer serious uncertainty in their determined flow paths because of the lack of variability, i.e., only eight allowed flow directions. Although uncertainty at the local level is an inherent problem residing in the domain discretization, this study shows that more reasonable flow paths at the global scale can be obtained by maximizing the use of all information stored in the given digital elevation data. By utilizing information stored in cells other than those in the direct vicinity, this alternative approach can reduce the uncertainty residing in the extraction of flow paths. The proposed algorithm makes a significant improvement in flow path variability on both theoretical and real landscapes, while it is still simple.},
