description = in this experiment I try to assess some certain parameters relating...

m 	= 			64	!number of rows
n 	= 			64	!number of columns

!climate /landscape parameters:

roughness 	= 	0.0000001
slope 		=	0.2			!slope of the topography
orientation = 	0.7853982 	!in radians
							!0.7853982 equals pi/4 which is 45 degree anticlockwise from east

nSteps 	= 		200 		!total number of "years"

!veg change variables
etPersist = 	200			!evapotranspiration rate over which plants start to grow
storEmerge =	120			!storage based emerge of new plants
useStorEmerge = T			!flag denotes whether to use random collonisation pc or storage based sEmerge
vegmax = 		9		!maximum biomass

	
tSteps= 		200 		!number of iterations for evap calcs between veg change

pa = 			250 		!mean annual precip mm
ts =	 		0.0128767       !duration of time raining in years (e.g.: days raining/days of year)


!infiltration kernel parameters:
K0 =  			0.2546103	!intrinsic hydraulic conductivity of the soil in the absence of plants in mm/hr 
Kmax = 			2.0461027 	!potential maximum hydraulic conductivity in mm/hr
kf = 			1.0 		!per meter : rate of decline in plant effect on infiltration
rf = 			5  		! meter: maximum length for plant effect on infiltration
dx = 			1		!spatial dimesions of lattice cells


Emax = 			876 		! 0.5 * (365.0* 24.0)  from mm/hr to mm/year

!evaporation kernel parameters
kc = 			0.6 		!per meter : rate of decline in plant water uptake with distance
rc = 			5 		!meter: maximum length for plant water uptake
gamma = 		0.5 		!relative reduction of soil evap under canopy
bav = 			0.1  		!scaling factor for Esb calc

!erosion

kb = 0.1d0
Dv = 0.1d0 !1.0
Db = 0.1d0 !m^2/kyr

topogRoute	= T !if true, then use topography to route flows
simErosion	= F !if true, then simulate erosion and update flow pathways
simEvap		= T !if true, then simulate evaporation
simVegEvolve    = T !if true, then simulate evolving vegetation
RandomInVeg	= T !if true, then allow vegetation to be randomly distributed initially, othewrwise set all veg to 0
BCs             =  0  0  0  0  !top, left, bottom and right boundaries codes
useRandomSeed   = T !if true, set random seed by clock
